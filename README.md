Learning Signal processing and SDR with numpy and scipy

Some jupyter notebooks + datafiles on my experiences to learn how to do signal-processing and SDR with python, numpy and scipy.signal.

This runs in a jupyter notebook with python3, numpy, scipy, scipy.signal and matplotlib.

If you run docker, this image will provide everything you need:
